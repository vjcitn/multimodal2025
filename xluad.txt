Here are two images from lung adenocarcinoma samples analyzed using 10x Xenium spatial transcriptomics platform.  Each image shows cell boundaries colored according to cell size.  The first image has a black dot wherever a transcript of EPCAM gene is found, the second image has a black dot wherever a transcript of IL7R is found.  Please describe the patterns observed in these images.

Looking at these two lung adenocarcinoma spatial transcriptomics images, distinct and biologically meaningful patterns emerge for each gene:

## **EPCAM Expression Pattern (First Image)**

The EPCAM transcripts (black dots) show highly organized, **clustered distribution** that forms distinct structural patterns:

- **Organized epithelial regions**: The black dots aggregate into well-defined, cohesive structures that appear to outline epithelial tissue boundaries
- **Structural organization**: These clusters form what appear to be glandular or ductal-like structures, consistent with adenocarcinoma architecture
- **Clear spatial boundaries**: The EPCAM-positive regions show sharp transitions, creating distinct epithelial compartments within the tissue
- **Association with larger cells**: The EPCAM clusters appear to coincide with regions containing larger cells (indicated by the color coding)

## **IL7R Expression Pattern (Second Image)**

The IL7R transcripts show a markedly different **dispersed distribution**:

- **Scattered pattern**: The black dots are more randomly distributed throughout the tissue without forming the organized structures seen with EPCAM
- **Immune infiltration signature**: This scattered pattern is consistent with immune cell infiltration, as IL7R is primarily expressed by T cells and other lymphocytes
- **Interstitial distribution**: The IL7R-positive cells appear to be distributed in the spaces between the organized epithelial structures
- **Smaller cell association**: The IL7R expression appears more associated with smaller cells, typical of lymphocytes

## **Biological Significance**

These contrasting patterns reflect the fundamental difference between:
- **EPCAM**: Marking epithelial cancer cells that maintain some degree of tissue organization
- **IL7R**: Marking infiltrating immune cells that are distributed throughout the tumor microenvironment

This spatial relationship provides insights into tumor architecture and immune infiltration patterns in lung adenocarcinoma.
